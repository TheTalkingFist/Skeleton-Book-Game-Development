# Why Deploy to Different Platforms?

We Need to Deploy to these Different Platforms for several reasons!

1. Increase in market Research
2. Revenue Opportunities
3. Player preferences
4. Technical Capabilities
5. Platform Specific Features
6. Marketing and Promotion

## Games Deployment

1. Same Game and Availiable different platform builds
2. Creates an Application package that will run on any desired platform 
3. Single Project can be deployed to various platforms with minimum modification
4. Game Build for different platforms can be easily distributed to players
5. Platforms: Windows, Mac, IOS, Android, Web GL


### File formats for the Different Platforms

1. Windows, .exe, executable file
2. MacOS, .app, Application Bundle
3. IOS, .ipa, IOS App Store Package
4. Android, .apk, Android Application Package
5. WebGL, (.html, .js, .unity3d), A set of files which are then hosted on a web server


## Preparing for Deployment in unity

### 1. Build Settings

### 2. Scene Setup

### 3. Asset Optimisation

### 4. Quality Settings

### 5. Player Settings

### 6. Platform-Specific Configuration

### 7. Testing and Debugging

### 8. Build and Deployment


## Methods for Deployment

### Manual Deployment

- Manually configure various settings and perform the necessary steps to prepare game for deployment on each target platform.

- Provides more control and customisation

### Deployment  Pipelines and Automation Tools

- Used to streamline deployment process and automate repetitive tasks which are standardised to execute sequentially

- Examples of such automation tools are:
    - Unity cloud build
    - Jenkins
    - Custom Scripts



## Setting up project for Game Development

1. First go to File

This provides a polished and professional appearance while loading the game.

This can also include:

- Branding: Incorporating game's branding elements into the splash image
