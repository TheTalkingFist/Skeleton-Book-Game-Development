I don't know how well I can do this chapter, to be honest. This seems like a very visual-based chapter, but I'll try my best.

This chapter deals with the following:

1. [[2 - Intro to the Game Engine Interface#Intro to the Unity Game Engine|Intro to the Unity Game Engine]]
2. [[2 - Intro to the Game Engine Interface#Preview on the Unity Setup|Preview on the Unity Setup]]
3. [[#Unity Interface]]
4. Tools in Unity
5. Default components in scene

# Intro to the Unity Game Engine

Say hello to the Game Engine of the term! Unity is a cross-platform game engine that can be used to develop both 2D and 3D games. Using and Adding the necessary modules, it supports multiple platforms, such as:
- WebGL
- Mac
- iOS

Unity scripting is based on Visual Studio, the IDE we're (most of us \[not me]) have been using the past two terms.

## ~~Unity Installation~~
~~To install Unity, first go to th~~

## ~~Creating a New Project~~
~~I don't need to show this either... right?~~


## Unity Interface

### <font color="#92d050">Hierarchy View</font>
This is where all of your Game Objects are listed. Each object can be dragged and reorganised by the developer.

### <font color="#f583ff">Project Window</font>
Here is where all of our asset files are kept. This includes .fbx models, .wav audio files, as well as prefabs.

I like to think of this as a File Explorer inside of Unity, because that's kinda what it is.

### <font color="#d99694">Scene View</font>
This is where we can see and build the scene of our game. Scenes can be stuff like levels, title screen, menus and cutscenes.

### <font color="#ffffff">Game View</font>
This is where you will see your game in action. What you see in this window is what you see when you play your scene, as an executable. When you play your project within Unity, you will be switched to this window where you can play and test your game.

### <font color="#00b0f0">Inspector Window</font>
Here is where the components of your game objects can be manipulated. It is empty by default, and will be populated with components of the game object you select.

### <font color="#f79646">Toolbar</font>
This panel provides access to your Unity Account and Unity's cloud services. It also contains the controls for Play Mode (for when you click the play button and test your game), and has the controls to switch the layout of your overall Unity window.

The rest will be mostly screenshots.

Sorry for the screenshots. I couldn't find a good way to explain these parts without visuals, and I figured I should keep you folks from having to switch between the skeleton book notes and the actual slides to a minimum. You're gonna have to do that next chapter. Again, sorry.
