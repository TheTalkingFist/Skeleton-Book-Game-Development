# Welcome Back to the Skeleton Book!
Sorry we couldn't get these out sooner.

Anyway, we're here! The last module of our school year! No matter how well you think you did, I'd like for you all to give yourselves a pat on the back, at least for making it this far.

The next 2 terms after this are eaten by our Internship, so you're not gonna see anymore instalments till term 3, I suppose.

Good luck for the exam, and we hope this helps!
