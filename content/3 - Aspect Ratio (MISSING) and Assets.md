# Aspect Ratio
**I'm skipping the Aspect Ratio portion of the notes**, as a lot of it is just annotated pictures. Same reason with the screenshots from last chapter. **You can just refer to the notes for the whole Aspect Ratio part**.

# Assets
All computer games are made with assets, such as:
- 3D assets
- 2D textures
- Sound files
- Game code

These are called Game Assets.


Assets are images, audio, video, scripts, text, 3D models, etc.

Publishing a project will package assets into a file(s), depending on the platform. The final size of the game is dependant on these assets.

## Common Asset Types
- Image Files
	- .BMP
	- .TIFF
	- .TGA
	- .JPG
	- .PSD
- 3D Model Files
	- .fbx
	- .dae (Collada)
	- .dxf
	- .obj
- Audio Files
	- .wav
	- .aiff
- Data Files
	- Text
	- HTML
	- XML
	- JSON

Remember these! I dunno if they're tested, but we wouldn't want a repeat of GC, would we?


## GameObjects
This covers basically all objects that are created in the scene, such as:
- Light Sources
- Audio Sources
- Camera
- 2D Sprites
- 3D Models
- UI Elements
...and a few.

Either way, all objects created are game objects.

Components for each game object will be assigned by the developer before it becomes a character, environment or special effect. [[4 - GameObjects and Components#Relationship Between Game Objects and Components|Components are taught in the next chapter.]]

GameObjects are like containers. Different components are added to the GameObject to turn them into a character, tree, light source, etc.

## Difference between GameObjects and Assets

### Assets
are representations of any item that can be used in the game or project. They come from files that are created outside of Unity, such as images, sounds, 3D models, etc.

### GameObjects
are the fundamental objects in Unity that represent characters, props and scenery. These are created in Unity.

Like the last chapter, the rest will be screenshots.
