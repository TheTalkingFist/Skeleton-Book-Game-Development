Just like everything else we've learned before, Game Development happens to also have a life cycle. This one is quite similar to the one from last term's SDP, so it might (should) be familiar to you all

- Idea
	- Filter
		- Analyse
			- Design
				- Develop
					- Test

## 1. Ideation

This is where the **initial concept or vision** for the game is identified by discussing with stakeholders. We should be gathering information on the following:

- Game Objectives
- Game Requirements
- Key Features and Functionalities
- Player Target Audience


## 2. Filter

**Evaluation and prioritisation** of the ideas is done. This also helps **narrow down the scope of the project**, and selecting the **most promising ideas**. This is kinda the gateway to the rest of the life cycle.


## 3. Analysis

Game requirements and stories would be explained in detail, and the team works closely with the stakeholders to:
- Gather and analyse game requirements
- Identify user needs
- Define acceptance criteria.

#### Analysis 1:
**Problems, risks and constrains are addressed**, such as **whether the team is skilled enough**, whether we have **enough money**, the time we have till a planned release, will the game be age-appropriate to what was planned, etc.

#### Analysis 2:
This one deals with documentations, such as:
- Game Design Document (GDD)
- Art Design Document (ADD)
- Technical Design Document (TDD)

#### Analysis 3:
This is where we try out our game mechanic idea to test its technical feasibility.

#### General Important Questions
- How much time and money could we have?
- Is the team skilled enough?
- Will the game be good on the platform it's being played on?
- What risks could hinder the project's completion as a whole?

For this phase, we have SWOT: **S**trengths, **W**eaknesses, **O**pportunities, **T**hreats.


## 4. Design

This is where we create the architectural and high-level design, such as:
- Game system architecture,
- Game data models, and
- Game UIs

In an **"Agile" cycle**, which we learned from SDP, it promotes the Just-In-Time (JIT) design, where the design is **iteratively refined and adjusted** and **lasts throughout the development process**.


## 5. Development

Here is where actual **game coding and artwork implementation** take place.

The **game requirements** and **design specifications** are followed to build the game **incrementally**.

The Agile cycle, in this context, promotes **short development life cycles** called iterations or sprints, where small features are **developed and implemented in each iteration**.


## 6. Testing

Here, we focus on **quality and functionality** of the game.

There are different types of testing, some of which you've seen before.

- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- User Acceptance Testing

Defects and issues are to be identified, reported and resolved in an iterative manner, similar to [[#5. Development|the Development phase]].

Runnable prototypes are tried for playability here, and is evaluated against the design specifications to ensure that it runs as expected. 

Important questions include:
- Is the UI intuitive and user friendly?
- Is there adequate feedback for player actions?
- Are the testers enjoying themselves?


## 7. Testing/Release

**Data and feedback** are **collected** into consideration in a **list of bugs** to **fix and improve the game**, until the game is finally released.

# Game Pitching

Game pitching is when you would present a game concept or idea to potential stakeholders. The goal of this phase is to convince the audience that your game is worth investing in. This is one of the key elements in a GDD. 

This usually happens in the pre-production stage.

### A Game Pitch Deck...
...is a visual presentation that accompanies your game pitch. It communicates the following:
- Game Concept
- Market Potential
- Business Strategy,
to stakeholders.

A Game Pitch Deck should contain:
- Title and intro of game
- Visuals and concept art
- Game concept and gameplay
- Target audience and market opportunity
- Team and expertise
- Monetisation strategy
- Dev plan and timeline
- Prototype build

So, how do you actually make a good game pitch?

- Know your audience
- Keep it concise
- Clearly define the game concept
- Visualise game experience
- Demo gameplay
- Highlight team and expertise
- Be passionate and authentic
- Be empathetic and open to feedback
