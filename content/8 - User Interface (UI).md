- #PrinciplesOfGameInterfaceDesign


## User Interface(UI) Design

The User Interface we play in games <font color="#ff0000">defines how  we as players interacts with the game and completes the task we are presented with.</font>

Something simple such as <font color="#00b050">Providing information like winning or losing in the HUD in the form of score, available lives/energy etc.</font>


## Different Interface Styles

There are Ultimately 4 categories to Classify Game Interfaces;

- Diegetic
- Non-Diegetic
- Meta
- Spatial


### Diegetic

Diegetic UI is a <font color="#ff0000">part of the story and part of the environment</font>, seamlessly part of the game world.

It is fairly difficult to design, especially in 3D Spaces

<font color="#00b050">Examples Include</font>:
     - Player's Health bar is glowing strip on the player character 
     - 3D Objects Such as Maps , Compasses in game
     - An Ammo Count on the Player's weapon
     - in-game speedometer residing in the viewer's dashboard 


### Non-Diegetic

A Non-Diegetic UI is <font color="#ff0000">on the Screen and Not part of the environment</font>. It is <font color="#ff0000">an overlay and not part of the game story.</font>

This UI is the most common and easiest to produce. <font color="#ff0000">Using 2D graphics and text that informs the player of their status and other in game information.</font>

<font color="#00b050">Common information include</font>:
     - Score, health, time
     - Level names
     - Ammunition in numbers
     - Speed
     - Mini Maps


### Meta

Meta UI Is a <font color="#ff0000">part of the story yet not in the game environment</font>. This UI interface is <font color="#ff0000">displayed on the screen.</font>

Meta is the event that is not occurring in the game environment, yet<font color="#ff0000"> is the result of what is happening in the game's story</font>

<font color="#00b050">Examples</font> include:
     - Character getting harmed and the screen is splattered in blood
     - A car crashes and the Windshield gets cracked or even shattered
     - In a 2D Game, the FOV is blurred or even damaged to signify the player taking damage.


### Spatial

Spatial UI <font color="#ff0000">gives out information within the Game environment itself and not in the story.</font>

<font color="#00b050">Examples</font> include:

<font color="#00b050">Example 1:</font>
     - Characters speaking to each other with thought bubbles above their heads
     - Replays info to the player on what the character/NPC is thinking
     - position the bubble is relative to the game world and location of the player

<font color="#00b050">Example 2:</font>
     - Coloured Arrows to indicate to the player the direction of the track the y are driving on


## Differentiation Between the UI

Think as if you are the character in the game, so if You the character can see it == it is Diegetic, if you cannot? == it is Non- Diegetic


How about the info in that specific scenario? Is the info related to the game's story? == then it is Meta, if it is FYI info == it is Spatial



## Principles of Game Interface Design

There are 7 Principles:

- Control
- State Visualization
- Metaphors
- Sound
- Consistency and Coherence
- Color
- Layout

### Control

Control is the Most Important Aspect. This is because it <font color="#ff0000">defines the control interface</font>
### State Visualization

Players do need to know their state in the game

So Data such as their progress in games <font color="#00b050">such as</font>:

- Score, Health, Ammunition Left
- Laps Completed, Location
- Time left etc.

### Metaphors

Metaphors are usually <font color="#ff0000">recognisable symbols associated with Meaning.</font>

<font color="#00b050">Examples</font> can be as such:
    -  The little triangle in the play button, which is recognised as both audio and video
    - Quit, Play, Pause, Return and other variety of other commands, even the settings button represented as a gear icon

These metaphors are also coloured!

Something as simple as Health bars, Green when you are at good health in acceptable range and red for the opposition.

### Sound

Sound integrated into the game interface is fairly important. This<font color="#ff0000"> provides feedbacks and alerts the player.</font>

The player will know when the button is activated when they hear lets say the familiar click sound, or  when something is wrong it plays the alarm sound etc. 

This deepens the game world:
     - Especially in FPS Games
     - Where player's footsteps, opening doors or wind in the trees provides that extra touch of realism

### Consistency and Coherence 

It is best to have <font color="#ff0000">no more than 2 types of fonts and sticking to one or two button shapes only.</font>

<font color="#00b050">Example:</font>

Main Interface round buttons can be used and square buttons can be  used for pop-up screens with respect to colouring and finish.
### Colour

With a coherent interfaces comes a good colour scheme. 

However, this <font color="#ff0000">depends on the game genre and contents of said game.</font>

A Colour scheme is used to <font color="#ff0000">determine the colours that will be used for buttons, backgrounds information boxes, interface controls and others.</font>

The Designers and Artists will also consider how icons and texts will appear and be readable.

For the best colouring on electronic devices, white or light coloured texts on a dark background is recommended.

### Layout

There are 4 key principles in graphic design:

1. Contrast
2. Repetition
3. Alignment
4. Proximity

A Layout covers the Alignment and Proximity.

Alignment <font color="#ff0000">positions interface elements to create a visual flow, forcing the player's eyes to look and follow areas of the screen.</font>

Proximity <font color="#ff0000">groups related elements together, allowing the player to look in only one location  for similar types of information or types of control interfaces.</font>
